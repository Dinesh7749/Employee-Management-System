# Employee-Management-System
Designed and developed an Employee Management System using Java, SpringBoot, MySQL and React. Implemented CRUD operations to add, view, edit, and delete employee records. The system showcases my proficiencyin full-stack development and demonstrates my ability to work with modern technologies commonly used in the industry.
